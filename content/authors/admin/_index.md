I am a Research Intern at the [NeuroPoly][1] Lab, Polytechnique Montréal, where I'll be starting my Ph.D. this Fall. My current work focuses on developing deep-learning-based methods for the segmentation of [Multiple Scelorosis][2] lesions from the MR images of the brain and the spinal cord. My master's thesis work focused on the three-dimensional segmenation of scoliotic spines from MR volumes using deep generative modelling techniques for unsupervised synthesis and uncertainty estimation in unsupervised learning problems. My greater goal is to make deep learning models more interpretable and explainable for their deployment in real clinical settings. 

Outside of work, I am an avid sports fanatic and mostly follow football, cricket and formula 1. I am also interested in behavioral economics and like to keep myself updated with the latest in cryptocurrency. Hit me up if you have any book recommendations or just to talk crypto!
